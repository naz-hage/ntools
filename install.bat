@REM The .NET Desktop Runtime installer logs its activities to the Windows temporary directory %temp%. The exact location can vary, 
@REM but it's typically in a location similar to this:
@REM ```
@REM C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Temp
@REM ```
@REM The log files generated by the installer will have a name like `Microsoft_Windows_Desktop_Runtime_-_8.0.1_(x64)_20240120081951.log` or similar,
@REM  depending on the version you installed and the time of installation.
@REM Please note that the log files are only created if the installer encounters an issue. If the installation is successful, log file may not be created.
