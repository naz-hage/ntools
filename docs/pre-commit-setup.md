DEPRECATED: pre-commit setup removed

The actionable pre-commit setup and installation instructions were removed from the docs because the project is not actively maintaining a pre-commit integration. Historical setup commands and examples exist in the repository history; search for `pre-commit` in the repo if you need to inspect the archived implementation.

The experimental script that previously ran as part of a custom hook was:

- `scripts/devops/devops-update-versions.ps1` (archived/experimental)

If you want to reintroduce or stabilize pre-commit support, please open an issue describing the desired goals and constraints and we can propose a minimal, maintainable plan.
