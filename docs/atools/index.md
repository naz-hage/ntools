# atools — Python helper tools (overview)

This section gives a short overview of the small Python helper tools in the `atools/` folder. Each tool has its own
reference page linked below with detailed usage, prerequisites, and examples.

Tools

- [sdo](sdo.md) — Simple DevOps Operations CLI tool for work item management (GitHub issues and Azure DevOps work items), repository operations, and pull request management across multiple platforms. Supports dry-run previews and automatic platform detection.
- [install-ntools.py](install-ntools.md) — Cross-platform installer for NTools and SDO; downloads and extracts NTools release ZIPs, then installs SDO with version synchronization; supports `--dry-run` and includes comprehensive safety checks.
