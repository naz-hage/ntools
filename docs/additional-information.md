- `$(MSBuildProjectFile)`: The file name of the project file.
- `$(MSBuildProjectName)`: The file name of the project file without the extension.
- `$(MSBuildProjectExtension)`: The extension of the project file.
- `$(MSBuildProjectFullPath)`: The absolute path of the project file.
- `$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)`: The directory of the MSBuild file that is currently being processed.
