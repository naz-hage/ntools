# Pre-commit Hooks (experimental)

DEPRECATED: pre-commit integration removed

The project previously experimented with a `pre-commit`-based workflow, including a custom `update-doc-versions` hook. That work has been deferred for now and the project does not maintain an active pre-commit integration.

If you need to locate the historical notes or the experimental implementation, see the archived setup doc in the repository history or search for `pre-commit` in the codebase. The development script previously referenced was:

- `scripts/devops/devops-update-versions.ps1` (archived/experimental)

If you want to reintroduce pre-commit support, open an issue describing desired goals and we can design a minimal, maintainable approach that avoids duplication and long-term drift.
