Nb.exe is also a command line tool that installs the development tools and run times required to build and test any solution. To build a target type Nb.exe [Target Name] The list of targets is generated by running the Nb.exe targets command. Nb.exe expects the nbuild.targets file to be present in the solution folder. Below is a full list of options that can be used with Nb.exe : Usage Nb.exe command [-json value] [-v value] [-url value] [-tag value] [-path value] [-buildtype value] [-repo value] [-branch value] [-file value] - command : Specifies the command to execute. list -> Lists apps specified in the -json option. install -> Downloads and installs apps specified in the -json option (requires admin privileges). uninstall -> Uninstalls apps specified in the -json option (requires admin privileges). download -> Downloads tools or apps listed in the -json option (requires admin privileges). targets -> Lists available build targets and saves them in the targets.md file. path -> Displays the environment PATH variable for the local machine. git_info -> Displays the current git information for the local repository. git_settag -> Sets the specified tag using the -tag option. git_autotag -> Sets the next tag based on the build type: STAGE or PROD. git_push_autotag -> Sets the next tag based on the build type and pushes to the remote repository. git_branch -> Displays the current git branch in the local repository. git_clone -> Clones the specified Git repository using the -url option. git_deletetag -> Deletes the specified tag using the -tag option. release_create -> Creates a GitHub release. Requires -repo, -tag, -branch, and -file options. pre_release_create -> Creates a GitHub pre-release. Requires -repo, -tag, -branch, and -file options. release_download -> Downloads a specific asset from a GitHub release. Requires -repo, -tag, and -path (optional, defaults to current directory). list_release -> Lists latest 3 releases for the specified repository (and latest pre-release if newer). Requires -repo. ---- The nbuild.exe can also execute targets defined in an nbuild.targets file if one exists in the current folder. To execute a target defined in nbuild.targets, simply use its name as the command. For example, if nbuild.targets defines a target named 'build', you can run it with: `nb.exe build` (one of list,install,uninstall,download,targets,path,git_info,git_settag,git_autotag,git_push_autotag,git_branch,git_clone,git_deletetag,release_create,pre_release_create,release_download,list_release, required) - json : Specifies the JSON file that holds the list of apps. Only valid for the install, download, and list commands. - By default, the -json option points to the ntools deployment folder: $(ProgramFiles)\\build\\ntools.json. Sample JSON file: https://github.com/naz-hage/ntools/blob/main/dev-setup/ntools.json (string, default=$(ProgramFiles)\\nbuild\\ntools.json) - v : Optional parameter which sets the console output verbose level ---- - if no command line options are specified with the -v option , i.e.: 'Nb.exe stage -v true` `Nb` will run an MSbuild target `stage` defined in a `nbuild.targets` file which present in the solution folder.

List Installed Applications nb.exe list -json $env:ProgramFiles\\tools.json Lists all applications specified in the provided JSON file. 2. Install Applications nb.exe install -json $env:ProgramFiles\\tools.json Downloads and installs applications specified in the JSON file (requires admin privileges). This checks if the application is already installed and if not it will install it. If the application is already installed, it will skip the installation. 3. Display Git Information nb.exe git_info Displays the current Git branch and tag information for the local repository. 4. Run a Build Target nb.exe stage -v true Runs the stage target defined in the nbuild.targets file with verbose output enabled. 5.
